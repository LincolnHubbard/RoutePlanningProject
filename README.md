# Route Planning Project
<p>Program to simulate the delivery of packages through downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. This project showcases how data structures such as hash maps and dictionaries can be used in conjunction with
algorithms such as the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to heuristically plan an efficent route for deliveries. Users can enter a time into the CLI (command line interface) to view the status of a single package, or all packages at that specific time</p>

<p><b>Future Enchancements:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a GUI to make program more user-friendly</li>
  <li>Actually show the physical location of each truck during their route using a map of Salt Lake City</li>
  <li>Allow users to select each truck's inventory in the program (currently this is manually done in the code)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Technologies Used:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.11</li>
  <li>PyCharm Community Edition 2023.2</li>
  <li>Microsoft Excel (To modify and export CSV files)</li>
</ul>
